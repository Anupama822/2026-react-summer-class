```

---

## Step 4

Create the following folder structure.

```
src
│

# Tasks

## Task 1 – Create Components

Create the following components.

- [ ] Header
- [ ] Footer
- [ ] ItemList
- [ ] Item

---

## Task 2 – Header Component

Build a Header component containing:

- [ ] Store logo or emoji
- [ ] Store name
- [ ] Search input
- [ ] Search button
- [ ] Navigation links
- [ ] Cart button

The design does not need to exactly match the sample, but it should be neat and responsive.

---

## Task 3 – Footer Component

Create a Footer component displaying:

- [ ] Copyright
- [ ] Current year (hardcoded is fine)

Example:

```
© 2026 Trend Shop
```

---

## Task 4 – Render Components

Inside **App.jsx**

- [ ] Import Header
- [ ] Import Footer
- [ ] Import ItemList
- [ ] Import products dataset
- [ ] Render all components

---

## Task 5 – Pass Props

Pass the products array to ItemList.

Example:

```jsx
<ItemList products={products} />
```

---

## Task 6 – Render Product List

Inside ItemList

- [ ] Receive products using props.
- [ ] Loop through the array using `map()`.
- [ ] Render an Item component for every product.

Example:

```jsx
products.map(...)
```

---

## Task 7 – Pass Individual Product

Pass a single product object to Item.

Example:

```jsx
<Item product={product} />
```

---

## Task 8 – Product Card

Each product card must display:

- [ ] Product Image
- [ ] Product Name
- [ ] Brand
- [ ] Category
- [ ] Description
- [ ] Rating
- [ ] Price
- [ ] Add to Bag button

---

## Task 9 – Format Price

Display the price with two decimal places.

Example

```
Rs. 149.00
```

Hint:

```
toFixed(2)
```

---

## Task 10 – Low Stock Badge

If

```js
stock <= 12;
```

Display a badge.

Example:

```
Only 12 left
```

---

## Task 11 – Empty Product List

If there are no products available,

display

```
No products available
```

instead of rendering product cards.

Hint:

Use conditional rendering.

---

## Task 12 – Sold Out Products

If

```js
stock === 0;
```

then

- [ ] Change the card background to grey.
- [ ] Disable the "Add to Bag" button.
- [ ] Change button text to

```
Sold Out
```

Hint:

Use conditional rendering and dynamic class names.
